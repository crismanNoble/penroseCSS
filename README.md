impulse
=======

*I made **[impulse](https://github.com/crismanNoble/impulse)** because despite the great boilerplates out there, I always spend too much time setting up my files when making a demo.*

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impulse_(physics))
>Impulse is:  
	the gun powder accelerating the bullet in a rifle,  
	the bow string accelerating the arrow,  
	the rocket engines accelerating the shuttle,  
	the fist accelerating the punching bag.  

and now, getting a usable skeleton directory and files in three lines.
